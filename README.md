# TCCMaterialLibrary

This is a library of materials, that can be used in macroscopic solid-state, mechanic, and fluidic thermal control elements.
It is the adjoint library of our open-source tool for modelling thermal control elements and thermal control circuits, TCCbuilder (https://github.com/katya5226/TCCbuilderApp).

Researchers around the world are kindly invited to contribute to the library.

If you wish to add materials to the libraray, please read Material classification.docx.
Create a folder for the material named with its ID and short name (see Material classification.xlsx for ID creation).
Create two subfolders: appInfo and data.
Input all the necessary files (in right format) in the folders (see Material classification.docx).
Add the material to the Material classification.xlsx tables (copy the file and add locally).
Add the flags of the material to materials_flags.csv (copy the file and add locally).
Sent the prepared files to katja.vozel@fs.uni-lj.si for review. After accepting the files, we will add them to the library.
